This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  For example:

```javascript
const myObject = null;
console.log(myObject.someProperty); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')
```

In React Native, this often happens when you're dealing with asynchronous data fetching.  The component might try to render before the data has loaded, resulting in a null or undefined object.

Another common scenario is when working with navigation parameters.  If you're accessing a parameter that doesn't exist, you'll encounter this error.

Finally, it can also occur if you have incorrectly initialized state or props.
